                            HIBERNATE
Here,
hibernate is :
			.Framework       which is  provided BY
			.JAVA     and 
			.also a Open source Relational Mapping (ORM) tools     that provides a 
			.framework to map object-oriented domain models to relational databases for web applications.
			
			.ORM(Object Relational Mapping)



Object-----> Relational ---->Mapping	

here we need to create a files:
							1. Model Class (eg: Employee.java)
							2. hbm hibernate  mapping  fileds in DB     (xml files)    (eg:employee.hbm.xml)
							3. cfg configuration  of DB					(xml files)    (eg:hibernate.cfg.xml)
							4. tester controller    -- it will communicate by using CONFIGURATION
							
							
Here how the files is INTER RELATED :

4--->3--->2--->1
4 files will going to call 3 files.
3 files will going to call 2 files.
2 files will going to call 1 files.							          
 
 
 //SUMMARY 
 Here,
 1. (4 FILES) TESTER can be a Main files  that Main files will going to call (3 FILES) DATABASE configuration , 
 that will check that the database configuration are fine or not.
 
 2.  AND (3 FILES) Then this DataBase configuration will go and check (2 FILES) the fields of database like do we have that table ,
 the files and everything.
 
 3. AND after that(2 FILES) will going to call (1 FILES) the operation whatever we are performing with this model class 
 beacuse the fields which we are defining that is in them (FILES 2,3,4)
 
 //
 
 so it means that all files are INTERRELATED.
 here the project we are creating is MAVEN PROJECT
 
 
 (here first perform all the task in
 prom.xml files,
 by adding dependencies
 
 //   <dependencies>
	  

  <dependency>
  	<groupId>mysql</groupId>
  	<artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
  	<version>8.0.28</version>
  </dependency>
  
    <dependency>
  	<groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
  	<artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
  	<version>5.4.32.Final</version>
  </dependency>
  
  
  </dependencies>
  // add this dependencies in proml.xml inside  </project> after </version>
